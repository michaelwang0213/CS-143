I believe everything works as specified.

I had trouble figuring out how to add stuff in Jinja. After half an hour, I still didn't figure it out so I ungracefully passed the summands in a form to python and used the produced value. 

On top of the previous and next buttons, I added additional buttons allowing users to visit pages up to 5 pages before and after the current page. The presentation is a bit wonky but it's still pretty neat.
